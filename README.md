This respository holds a copy of my "dotfiles". To use these yourself pull down
a copy of the repository and rename the repository folder "~/.dotfiles". To set
them up run ~/.dotfiles/dot-install.sh. This script will preserve all of your
original dotfiles in ~/.dotfiles/system-originals/ if you need them for any
reason.

You'll also want to set the appropriate name and email that you want to show up in
git commit messages in ~/.dotfiles/system-specific/git-user-info.sh. This will
automatically be sourced and you won't have to set it in the gitconfig file. This
was done to allow different names and emails be used between work and home machines.

I do not offer any support on these files as they are primarily for personal use
and anyone that is using them should at least know how to read man pages and
search for answers on there own.

You agree to hold me harmless and not at all liable for any mental distress,
reduction of intellectual capacity, loss of data, eye spasms, difficulty
breathing, frothing at the corners of the mouth, flared nostrils, pounding
headaches, pounding stomachaches, incessant sounds of still-beating hearts
coming from under the floorboards, sleepless nights, listless days,
interminable afternoons, allergic reactions, seething hatred, roiling hatred,
burning hatred, fermenting hatred, soft pillowy hatred, or hair-tearing, whether
self-inflicted or imposed on loved ones, resulting from the use of these files.

For the real legitimate license of these files please refer to the LICENSE file
that was distributed with this collection.

Enjoy ;)
